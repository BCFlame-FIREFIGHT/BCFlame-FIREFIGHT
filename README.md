- 👋 Hi, I’m @BCFlame-FIREFIGHT
- 👀 I’m interested in alot of stuff, but my main things are making and playing games (alot. Like, bassically my whole life), making and listening to music, drawing art/sketching, filming/animating (visual media), and making new worlds and people (I get lost in my imagination alot during my free time).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make and edit videos.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything creative and/or fun.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at danny082495@Gmail.com, or danny082405@outlook.com.
(Fair warning, I'm not the best at coding, and I'm still learning.)
